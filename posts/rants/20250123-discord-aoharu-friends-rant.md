An excerpt from Discord on a random thought I had about the Project Sekai April Fools band shuffle.

I have a Project Sekai rant  
So, in Leo/need's main story, things start out with Saki being hospitalized and Ichika, Honami, and Shiho drifting apart from each other during that time  
and then goes through the story of Saki returning to school and the four of them eventually working through their issues and starting the bad  
Very cool and heartwarming stuff  
Anyway, fastforwarding to the first April Fools event  
they did a thing where they mixed up the members of the groups into new Legally Distinct™ groups  

![Project Sekai April Fool's event unit groupings](https://i.snap.as/ROx8Fq2I.jpg)

like so  
Aoharu/friends is the group based off of Leo/need  
and you may note that Ichika and Saki are the only OG Leo/need members there  
meaning it is possible that the April Fools event takes place in an alternate universe where Leo/need never actually reconciled with each other  

Also notable:
- Shiho and Shizuku being part of the MMJ clone, implying that they might have had a better relationship with each other than they did in canon
- An being a part of the MMJ clone, implying that RAD WEEKEND either never happened or didn't have as powerful an impact on her
- Tsukasa being a part of the VBS clone, implying that Saki never took an interest in the stage show they saw together
- Honami, Minori, and Nene being a part of the N25 clone, given their respective backstories and the theme of depression that N25 tends to explore in canon
