Man  
SIF2 is somehow simultaneously a really fun throwback to my first foray into rhythm games  
and a super disappointing mess  
It is just "SIF but with an updated UI"  
which, despite what the rest of the community thinks, I don't think it necessarily a reason it shouldn't exist  
but a lot of the implementation feels lazy and not well put together  
Lots of little things  
like button presses feel super unsatisfying between the audio and visual feedback  
and a lot of the various menus just play the main menu theme rather than having a unique background track  
But despite all that, just playing SIF again was a ton of fun  
Brought me back to the early days of playing rhythm games on the lowest difficulty, not really challenging myself, and still having a ton of fun  
It's a massive shame that SIF is just going to not exist anymore, because it's definitely a thing that needs to continue to exist

I haven't even been that attached to SIF for a pretty long time  
but I was reminded today that SIF was actually my first rhythm game  
and while I was streaming, I was reminded how influential it was for my choice to transition over to Bandori  
which was the reason I ended up transitioning over to Project Sekai  
so basically without SIF I probably wouldn't be into rhythm games at all
