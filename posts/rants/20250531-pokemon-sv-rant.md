## Transcript

So, does playing this game a second time change my opinion of it? Not really.

The performance is actually worse than I remember it being. Normally, I don't even include performance in my critiques of this game because it's Pokémon. It's never been known for having the best performance. But it was particularly bad this time around.

There are a lot of really weird graphical glitches, as well, with graphics popping up where they shouldn't be and menu items not updating completely. It's very bizarre.

Offline raids are more stable than they used to be. Online raids are still a complete mess.

The story of the game is kind of just non-existent until you complete everything, and then it just all kicks off, and it's all the area zero stuff. So the story feels worse than every other Pokémon game.

I didn't enjoy the star bases at all. The titans were just kind of there, and the gym challenge was the only actually entertaining part. But the challenges before you actually got into the battle I didn't enjoy.

I mentioned a few times that I took a very weird route through the game, and it is cool that you can do that, but at the same time there's still basically an enforced route that you have to take if you don't want to have to stop and grind between stuff. It doesn't make sense to me to make an open-world game and then have an enforced route that you have to take through the game if you want to be able to enjoy it optimally.

I don't know. It's not for me. That was my conclusion on my first playthrough, and that's my conclusion again now.
