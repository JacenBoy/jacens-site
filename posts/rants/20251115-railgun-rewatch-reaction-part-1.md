{% spoiler %}Beware of "A Certain Scientific Railgun" spoilers{% endspoiler %}

"A Certain Scientific Railgun" was one of the first anime I ever watched, and it has continued to hold up to scrutiny on every rewatch I've done. However, with how much of a masterpiece I claim that "BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!" is, can I still call it my favorite? There's only one way to find out, and that's to watch it again and give a play-by-play of my thoughts.
<!-- more -->

Railgun is a pretty long series, with the first season being 24 episodes. Therefore, I'll be splitting this into multiple parts. This part will cover up to episode 14, which is what I see as the conclusion of the Level Upper arc. So, with that out of the way, let's jump into it.

## Episode 1

We start things off with a bit of a bang, with Kuroko Shirai tracking down some criminals with the help of Kazari Uiharu. Ultimately, they're foiled by our titular Railgun, Mikoto Misaka, taking care of pests in the only way she knows how.

In the middle of this opening, we also get a brief overview of what exactly Academy City is thanks to a random tour bus. Railgun does assume you've already watched "A Certain Magical Index", so explanations like this one are pretty short. If you haven't already watched Index, you'll want to make sure you pay close attention to make sure you don't miss any details.

In the aftermath of the drama of the opening scene, with Misaka ignoring Kuroko's rebukes about getting involved, they begin the walk to school for their "system scan", basically a physical examination. The term "system scan" is a bit of a hint of what kind of place Academy City *really* is under the mask of a giant school, but we'll have a chance to explore that later.

Part of the system scan is an Esper ability test, so let me give you the Cliffs Notes on how Esper abilities work. Students who go through Academy City's ability development program gain the ability to affect the world in various ways by projecting what the show refers to as a Personal Reality. Consider the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, with a cat locked in a box with a flask of poison, some radioactive material, and a Geiger counter that will break the flask if it detects radiation. Until the box is opened, according to quantum theory, the cat is in a state of being both alive and dead. Ignoring for a moment how braindead of a theory that is ([which was, actually, Schrödinger's entire point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation#Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat)), imagine a Personal Reality as the Esper getting to decide whether the cat was alive or dead as they opened the box.

In Academy City, Espers are ranked on a level scale of 0 to 5, with 0 being no ability and 5 being the most powerful ability. In Academy City, there are 7 level-5 Espers, with Misaka being ranked 3rd among them, as Kuroko will explain later. Note that the ranking system among the level 5s is less about strength and more about how useful their ability is for research purposes. Regardless, a level 5 higher on the ranking is still more likely to win in a fight against a lower-ranked Esper.

Now that you're caught up, the system scan also exposes one of Railgun's weaknesses: the fanservice. Personally, I'm not overly bothered by it, but it's extremely prevalent throughout the Level Upper arc. It does tone down over time, but it still makes it a bit difficult to recommend to people with how front-loaded it is, and not everyone is as open-minded about fanservice in anime as I am. Just trust me: it gets better.

With a gratuitous shower scene out of the way, we're reunited with Uiharu and introduced to her best friend, Ruiko Saten (aka Best Girl). The two of them also had their system scan, with Uiharu being rated at a level 1 and Saten a level 0. In case you were completely zoned out earlier, Kuroko is ranked a level 4.

Uiharu, as it turns out, has plans to meet with Kuroko so she can be introduced to Misaka. Uiharu is quite excited for this meeting, and she manages to drag Saten along for the ride. Notably, Saten's role in this meeting is anime-original, as in the manga Saten doesn't appear until later. This doesn't really affect the story in any meaningful way (other than giving us the opportunity to meet Best Girl an episode early), but it's an interesting bit of trivia. The more you know.

Misaka's original plan to take Uiharu and Saten for an afternoon at the arcade is derailed when they receive flyers for a crepe stand that is offering a free giveaway of a Gekota figure. As much as she tries (and fails) to hide it, Misaka is quite taken with the character. I can't say I blame her; he is quite a cute character.

![My personal Gekota plush](https://i.snap.as/mEOxy5vJ.jpg)

Bet you weren't expecting that exposition tour to be plot relevant later. It turns out that they, too, have decided to stop at this specific crepe stand. In addition to being a useful plot point in a moment, it also creates the added drama of the stand running out of their prize just before Misaka has a chance to place her order. This creates a nice early bonding moment between Saten and Misaka as Saten offers to let Misaka have her Gekota figure.

Our introductory bonding episode is interrupted by a bank robbery across the street from the crepe stand. It's convenient and time-saving to have criminals that come to you.

I didn't mention this earlier, but Kuroko and Uiharu are members of Judgement, Academy City's student-run peacekeeping force. Usually their duties are basic things like cleaning the streets and directing traffic, but they're also authorized for law enforcement in a pinch, and this certainly qualifies as a pinch. Unlike Academy City's actual law enforcement, they aren't allowed to be armed, but in a city full of students who could kill you with their minds, are you ever *really* unarmed?

Kuroko easily dispatches of one unnamed goon and one Ryouta Okahara. In case you couldn't tell by the fact that he has a name, Ryouta will be relevant later.

Speaking of relevance, remember when I said that the exposition bus would be a plot point again later? It's later.

One of the students from the tour has wandered off, and Misaka, Uiharu, and Saten agree to look for him. Saten manages to track him down as the other unnamed goon tries to kidnap him. Trying to play hero, Saten manages to save the kid but gets a kick to the face for her efforts.

Bad move on the generic goon's part.

Misaka is very defensive of her new friend, and she ignores Kuroko's warnings to not get involved. We've gotten hints of just how powerful Misaka is, but this is our first opportunity to see it in action.

Misaka's ability is to generate electrical currents, and if you can generate an electrical current, you can generate a magnetic field. This is why she's 3rd ranked of the level 5s; her ability is multi-faceted. These two applications aren't mutually exclusive to each other, either. If you apply a magnetic force to an electrically charged object, you get a Lorentz force. With all this in mind, if you have two parallel electrical currents running parallel to each other, you get two magnetic fields that attempt to repel each other. If you place an electrically conductive projectile between the currents and complete the circuit, Lorentz force comes into play, and you get...

![Misaka's Railgun](https://i.snap.as/7C5svF0i.png)

...the Railgun.

With all three robbers taken care of, Anti-Skill comes in to clean things up. This is the true law enforcement of Academy City, as well as their military force. In particular, Anti-Skill members Aiho Yomikawa and Tsuzuri Tessou will be the ones we get most familiar with over the course of the show.

I don't think the anime does quite as good of a job as the manga of showing how important of a character Ryouta is. I don't really consider this a spoiler since the manga spells it out more, but the fact that Ryouta is a level 3 pyrokinetic is relevant to the overall plot of the Level Upper arc.

Regardless, it's a happy ending for our core quartet. It's also the beginning of a very interesting journey.

## Episode 2

Overall, I think "A Certain Magical Index" is a complete letdown of an anime, and I think it legitimately detracts from the enjoyment of Railgun if you choose to watch Index first. With that said, the opening scene of episode 2 *does* definitely assume you've already seen Index and treats our mystery spikey-haired boy as such. I could leave you in suspense, but I'll just tell you instead: his name is Touma Kamijou, and he's a little bit important to the plot of Index.

He also has the ability to completely cancel out Misaka's ability, something you might not have realized was being implied in the aftermath of Misaka's assault on him if you didn't know what you were looking for.

This is a purely filler episode. Kuroko has planned a celebration for her and Misaka's one-month roommate anniversary in typical Kuroko fashion. Unfortunately for her, Misaka has invited Uiharu and Saten to the dorm room. While initially disappointed, Kuroko has a very different vision of Misaka's endgame than Misaka does, so she goes along with things.

After an extended review of Kuroko's underwear collection (did I mention the fanservice?) and a look through a photo album of Misaka's childhood, we do get a tiny sliver of plot relevance: Misaka states that she started as a level 1 Esper, working her way up the ladder to level 5. It's certainly a good story, and I'm sure Academy City's marketing is happy to take advantage of it whenever possible. Like many stories of grinding from the bottom to the top, there's probably a bit more nuance to it than that, but that's a conversation to be had in a future arc.

Regardless, Kuroko feels a bit abandoned with Misaka not remembering the one-month roommate-versary, although Misaka remembers events a bit differently than Kuroko does and doesn't appreciate Kuroko trying to play the victim. The arrival of a special aphrodisiac delivery (something something fanservice) does not improve the situation. Things escalate pretty quickly between the two skilled Espers.

The Tokiwadai dorms have strict rules prohibiting the use of abilities within their walls, and the head resident takes these rules seriously. You have to hand it to the head resident: it takes a very particular kind of person to not flinch in the face of the third most dangerous person in the city and bring her to heel effortlessly.

Kuroko and Misaka are relegated to pool cleaning duty as punishment, where Misaka is introduced to Kinuho Wannai and Maaya Awatsuki, two of Kuroko's classmates. These are very underrated characters, but they do get their time in the spotlight come season 3. For now, though, they are unfortunately just background characters.

Kuroko is still dealing with her issues with being excluded, but Misaka happens to have a plan: a gift that she picked out during the shopping trip with Uiharu and Saten just before the dorm visit. As much as they fight and bicker, Misaka really does care about Kuroko a lot.

The rest of the episode does devolve into chaos and fanservice, but hopefully the core message still stands.

## Episode 3

You may remember Mitsuko Kongou from episode 1. She is a second-year at Tokiwadai Middle School and a level 4 Esper. She is also the designated victim of this episode's opening scene. She is ambushed and swiftly defeated by an unseen assailant. What the attackers motives are, we'll find out in a bit.

Meanwhile, Uiharu and Saten are invited by Kuroko for a trip to the Garden of Learning, the area of Academy City that houses Tokiwadai and one of its dorms, as well as four other elite girls schools and a handful of high-class shops and restaurants to keep all these rich girls entertained. I say "one of the dorms" because Tokiwadai has two sets of dormitories: one inside the garden and one outside of it. The latter is the one that Kuroko and Misaka live in. Uiharu, naturally, is excited to visit such an exclusive area, although Saten is also more interested in the trip than she initially lets on.

The weather forecast might not seem like a big deal, but I'd like to touch on it for a moment. You'll note that Uiharu has access to weather data so accurate that she can predict when the rain will stop to the second. What isn't mentioned is that this forecast, along with many other predictive algorithms within Academy City, is created by Tree Diagram, Academy City's powerful supercomputer. Its accuracy is unmatched, and when it speaks, no one questions it. Tree Diagram and its accuracy will not be relevant for quite a while, but file it away for season 2 in particular.

Unfortunately, disaster strikes as Saten slips in a puddle on the way to the meeting, forcing her to borrow one of Kuroko's spare Tokiwadai uniforms. Misaka arranges for Saten's uniform to be sent to be professionally cleaned and even delivered back to Saten's apartment without a second thought. Sometimes the show likes to remind you that beyond the tomboyish and prickly exterior, Misaka is actually a rich girl.

Kuroko and Uiharu are called away mid-meeting for emergency Judgement work. We're introduced to Mii Konori, Chief of Judgement's 177th branch. She briefs us on the attack that we saw in the opening scene.

There has been a string of attacks on Tokiwadai students, all taking place within the Garden of Learning. The victims aren't able to see their attacker, and all of them are swiftly dispatched with a stun gun before they have an opportunity to fight back.

Remember Saten's uniform? I think you see where this is going.

As for the victim's aim... it's drawing thick eyebrows on their foreheads with marker. Whatever you're into, I guess.

The attacker, as mentioned, was able to make herself invisible, according to the victims. Uiharu and Kuroko make a list of Espers with optical manipulation abilities, all of whom have alibis. Notably, however, the attacker *does* show up on security cameras, meaning it's possible her ability isn't optical manipulation at all. This gives Misaka a brain wave, which she shares with Uiharu and Kuroko.

Dummy Check is an ability to reduce people's awareness of an object, something that could potentially help someone slip under the radar. It's an ability held only by one Miho Juufuku, making her our prime suspect. The catch is that she's only a level 2 Esper, and her test results state that she doesn't have the strength to fully conceal herself with her ability.

Despite the level discrepancy, Saten can confirm that Juufuku is the girl who attacked her; she was able to see her attacker in the mirror before she was knocked out. Doing the attack in the bathroom was Juufuku's first mistake.

With the suspects narrowed down to one and the very specific area that she operates in, it's only a matter of time before Juufuku is picked up by one of the around 2,000 security cameras that monitor the Garden of Learning. This number can be narrowed down even further since the targets are specifically Tokiwadai students, meaning areas where Tokiwadai students rarely frequent can be excluded. Having such a specific MO would be Juufuku's second mistake. Not the smartest of criminals.

Misaka also suggests excluding high-traffic areas. Juufuku can't keep her ability active forever, and her school uniform isn't from one of the schools within the Garden of Learning, meaning she would stand out quite a bit. Presumably, she *is* at least clever enough to spend as little time as possible in areas where she'll stick out.

With all that, tracking Juufuku down is a piece of cake, and with Uiharu playing mission control, keeping track of her is even easier. Cornered, Juufuku makes one final attack on Misaka, who is unaffected thanks to her Electromaster ability. Definitely not the brightest criminal.

As for motive, Juufuku had a boyfriend who left her for a Tokiwadai girl because of her own very thick eyebrows. In retribution, Juufuku decided to make sure everyone had eyebrows like hers.

Did I mention that she's not very bright?

With Juufuku successfully arrested (and Saten making the mistake of extending an olive branch and making a somewhat obsessive new friend), Judgement is left with the question: why was Juufuku's level information incorrect in the ability database?

More on that in a moment.

## Episode 4

This is *almost* filler, but it does, unfortunately, have just a smidge of plot relevance, so strap in.

Saten has a love for urban legends and the like. A shame she doesn't get any screentime in Index; she would almost certainly love the magic side of things. Regardless, the urban legend on the menu today is the Undresstress, a strange woman with a penchant for removing her clothes in public. An unusual horror story, but we'll let Saten cook for the moment.

Misaka and Kuroko are not super impressed with Saten's story, so Uiharu helpfully provides us with a handful of others from the same urban legend site. Among the featured ones are wind turbines spinning in reverse, the imaginary number school district, a tool that can instantly improve your Esper ability called the Level Upper, and a boy with the power to negate other powers. At least one of these should have caught your attention, given the name of this arc, but you might recognize one or both of the first two if you're a Raildex veteran.

The origin story of the meeting between Misaka and Touma is one that has changed multiple times across different installments and adaptations of Raildex, so I wouldn't put much stock in Misaka's flashback here (for a wonder, the version in the Index anime is actually better). Regardless, it should be more clear that Touma is, in fact, the boy with the power to stop other people's.

Conveniently, immediately following our flashback, Touma happens to be trying to help a woman figure out where she parked her car. If you're watching the dub, you'll note that he refers to Misaka as "bug zapper" ("zapper" for short). Many fans prefer the Japanese version, "biribiri" (the Japanese onomatopoeia for an electrical shock). Personally, I think "zapper" is more charming.

As Touma and Misaka argue about who should take responsibility for helping the woman, she abruptly decides that the best way to deal with the increasing heat is to take off her shirt.

I'd ask "sounds familiar?" here, but I think that's a little too on the nose, even for me.

Misaka also has the same idea and briefs Kuroko over the phone. Saten and Uiharu are quite worked up over the appearance of the legendary Undresstress, while Kuroko and Misaka are still unconvinced at this point.

The mysterious woman offers Misaka a drink of curry soup as a thank-you for her help, claiming that a hot drink is better for you on a hot day. I'm not a medical professional, and this is not medical advice, but from my research, there's nothing that backs up this claim. Regardless of what you drink, your body will react accordingly to maintain your normal body temperature. A hot drink will cause you to sweat more, and the evaporation of the sweat will provide a cooling effect (assuming you're in an environment where the sweat will evaporate properly; in a humid environment, this doesn't work). A cool drink will simply reduce your core body temperature and cause you to sweat less. The woman also cites that curry's spices have various positive medical properties, which *does* seem to be true, at least.

The woman is a researcher who specializes in the study of AIM Diffusion Fields. We'll actually have a chance to explore this later, but AIM stands for "An Involuntary Movement". As you can see, they went all-out with the creative acronyms in Raildex. Regardless, all Espers unconsciously emit a weak energy field called an AIM Diffusion Field. The effect and properties of this field vary from Esper to Esper. For example, in Misaka's case, her AIM Diffusion Field manifests in a weak electromagnetic field around her body.

Pseudoscience aside, Misaka's conversation with the woman is interrupted by a passing child who accidentally spills ice cream on her skirt. The woman is gracious, assuring the kid that it will wash off easily as she begins to remove her skirt.

Is this what it's like for you guys dealing with my running gags?

Meanwhile, Saten continues her efforts to radicalize Kuroko into believing the legend of the Undresstress, and eventually manages to succeed. This will have consequences for Misaka later.

After a quick clean and dry of the woman's skirt in the bathroom (featuring Misaka's unamused response to being accused of "playing hard to get" with Touma), they finally make their way to her car, where the two finally part ways. As she makes her way back home, Misaka discovers a distraught Touma lamenting a carton of eggs that he accidentally dropped. This is why Touma pushed helping the mystery woman onto Misaka: there was a sale on eggs that he absolutely wanted to get to.

Misaka, hotheaded as ever, challenges Touma to a duel as punishment for all the misadventures she went through. Touma, reluctantly, agrees to take her on.

You might remember from your science classes (or, at the very least, from my explanation in episode 1) some basics of electricity. Of course, it can be used to shock somebody. Air is a good insulator, but it has a tendency to move around, and a strong enough arc can pierce through it, allowing for a strong attack from a distance, especially if you happen to be a certain level 5 Esper. However, it has more uses than just that. If you can create an electrical current, that means you can create a magnetic field. This allows you to do some even more creative and crazy stuff, such as collecting ironsand from the ground. With skillful control, the magnetic field can be modulated to vibrate said ironsand extremely rapidly, like a reciprocating saw. Or, more accurately, millions of tiny reciprocating saws.

> "Fair warning, it might hurt a bit if it touches you!"

Fortunately for Touma, his right hand is able to counter the ironsand attack just as well as it does the electric attacks. Misaka, however, is a quick thinker and comes up with another use for the ironsand attack: a distraction.

While Touma is busy with the ironsand, Misaka has time to sneak up behind and grab him, planning an attack at point-blank range.

Only one minor tactical error: she specifically grabs his *right* hand.

With all the heroics, it's easy to forget that she's just a 14-year-old kid. Facing someone a year older and much stronger physically than her without the use of the one thing that gives her any kind of advantage, it's understandable that she's quite scared.

However, she's also very headstrong and short-tempered. So, she doesn't take it very well when Touma pretends to lose for her benefit.

Remember when I said that Saten's corruption would have consequences later? It's later.

After a night of chasing Touma around town, Misaka returns to her dorm to be jumped by Kuroko, who believes Misaka has been cursed by the Undresstress.

Hijinks ensue, or whatever.

## Episode 5

Some people criticize Railgun's use of filler. I, however, feel like it's a good opportunity to show us exactly why we should care about and be invested in these characters. Episode 5 is a good example of this. It might seem like a basic filler episode to fill time (probably because it is), but it serves to give us just a bit more backstory and perspective on our primary characters.

Remember that Judgement is *not* primarily a law enforcement force; their main mission is to keep the peace and help out people who are having minor troubles. However, occasionally use of force *is* required, so it seems like they go through strict training.

This is how we get a flashback of an elementary-aged Kuroko and Uiharu from about a year earlier. As Uiharu bemoans her lack of athleticism, Kuroko shares with us one of Judgement's core philosophies.

> "You must always follow your convictions and act in the way you feel is right."

Surprisingly deep for a shonen anime.

Back in the present, as Kuroko and Uiharu are helping out another Judgement branch, they happen to overhear a car robbery in progress. Kuroko is ready to swoop in, ignoring Uiharu's suggestion that they wait for backup. As it turns out, there was a second thief that they were unaware of, who ambushes Kuroko and knocks her off her feet. [Talking is normally a free action](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction) in the Raildex universe, but in this case, Kuroko's grandstanding seems to have given them time to prepare for her. Uiharu tries to act as the last line of defense and takes a hit from a stun gun for her trouble.

With emotions already high between the two close friends after such a close shave, it's not surprising that they devolve into bickering about Kuroko's reckless and headstrong attitude. However, it's during this argument that Kuroko commits the *real* cardinal sin: forgetting a promise she and Uiharu made around a year ago.

Saten visits the 177th branch to find Uiharu in a very bad mood, while Kuroko annoys Misaka by moping around at the dorm. Konori briefs Saten while Kuroko fills in Misaka on exactly what happened about a year ago to bring Kuroko and Uiharu together as partners.

To set the stage: Kuroko and Konori are on patrol when Konori stops by a nearby bank to withdraw some cash. Uiharu happens to be in the area, looking at potential middle school options.

Notably, in the initial interaction between Kuroko and Uiharu, Kuroko is vocally disdainful of Tokiwadai (despite having already enrolled there) and Misaka in particular, expecting a school full of stuck-up rich girls. What exactly changed to shift Kuroko's perspective of Misaka is unclear, and we'll probably never know, although there's a nice fanfiction called ["A Certain Destined Introduction"](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6373544/) by Cun that's *almost* canon-compliant and tells a nice story of how Kuroko and Misaka might have come to be a pairing.

Mid-conversation, Kuroko notices Konori acting odd. Konori, in turn, has noticed one of the customers seems to be up to no good. Konori is a level 3 Esper with the ability of Clairvoyance, effectively x-ray vision. It's a convenient skill for a peacekeeping officer, and it lets her detect that the odd customer has a gun.

Konori swiftly rejects Kuroko's suggestion that they arrest the robber, stating that it's "a job for Anti-Skill". Kuroko is clearly not pleased with that idea, and she gets the opportunity to act when the robber makes his move earlier than anticipated. She disarms and dispatches him easily.

Unfortunately, what she didn't realize is that there's a second robber.

Sound familiar?

The second robber takes Uiharu as a hostage, and Kuroko makes the mistake of reacting in a way that makes it clear the two are friends. That gives our hostage-taker some extra leverage.

To make matters worse, one of the bank employees panics and hits the alarm, closing the security shutters and trapping everyone inside. It also activates one of Academy City's security robots, which Kuroko realizes she can use as cover for her own attack. Konori spots the flaw in Kuroko's plan, but Kuroko is already in motion.

As Kuroko charges, the robber reveals his own attack, destroying the robot in an explosion that, at such close range, severely injures Kuroko.

...is what would have happened if Konori hadn't launched herself in the way at the last possible second.

Thanks to Kuroko's actions, the situation is about as bad as it could possibly be. Lots of innocent civilians trapped inside with a hostage taker, the senior Judgement officer incapacitated, and Kuroko herself being at a severe combat advantage to the criminal.

So, she salvages the one thing she can from the situation: teleporting Uiharu out of the building safely.

Now free, Uiharu cries desperately for help, and her pleas reach the ears of a passing Tokiwadai student with a distinct Gekota charm on her bag.

Meanwhile, back in the bank, our robber reveals his escape plan, the same ability he used on the security robot.

Consider Newton's first law: "an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by another force". If you were to roll a basketball across your bedroom floor, a lot of forces would act against it, such as friction, air resistance, and probably eventually a wall, causing it to eventually come to a stop.

Unless, of course, you're an Esper who can just say "no" to physics.

Enter the ability Equal Speed, the ability to put an object in motion and maintain it at a fixed direction and velocity until either the object is destroyed or the user releases their ability. A person could use this ability to, purely hypothetically, pierce a metal security shutter with a steel ball to make a daring escape from a locked-down bank.

Just when you think the situation can't get any worse.

Regardless, Kuroko decides to make one last stand to apprehend the robber.

> "I believe in the power of justice, and I'll never stray from that."

The power of Equal Speed isn't a particularly fast one. Kuroko is betting that, even severely beaten with an injured ankle, she can dodge the robber's attacks.

What she did not consider is that Equal Speed can control more than one object at a time. Considering that at this point Kuroko has not yet developed her ability to the point where she can teleport herself, this is pretty much game over.

If not for a certain Gekota-obsessed Tokiwadai student.

With the projectiles neutralized and her opponent stunned, Kuroko has an opening to finally turn things around. Even at point-blank range, one steel ball powered by Equal Speed is too slow to help him at this point.

In the aftermath, as Uiharu helps patch up Kuroko, we finally reach the forgotten promise.

> "Let's become full-fledged Judgement officers together."

Once again back in the present, Uiharu managed to pick up a lead on the car thieves. With just a little nudge from Misaka, Kuroko jumps in to help out.

Even a good friendship will have rough patches, but they'll always find a way to make up.

## Episode 6

Our episode opens with a small stuffed bear morphing oddly and exploding in a bush. The explosion is small, more like a firecracker than anything. However, it's apparently not the first time this has happened; there has been a rash of such explosions disguised as stuffed animals or other toys. The only lead Judgement has on these is a spike in graviton particles in the area of the explosion just before it happened. Gravitons are hypothetical particles related to theories of quantum gravity. In the Raildex universe, where quantum mechanics are the playthings of Espers, it seems they are more than simply "theory". The bomber used aluminum as a base, accelerating gravitrons through it in such a way that it exploded.

According to Judgement's investigations, the ability responsible for this is Synchrotron, and a level 4 ability would be required to make aluminum explode. The only level 4 Esper with this ability is Katabira Kushiro. Unfortunately, she has an alibi: she's been in a coma for 8 days. Airtight stuff.

The concept of a mystery Esper excites Misaka, but Kuroko shoots her down. Remember that Kuroko has a very strong sense of justice, and Misaka acting as a vigilante isn't something she would ever approve of. This investigation is a job for Judgement, and Kuroko believes civilians need to butt out.

Misaka, headstrong as ever, does not appreciate Kuroko's rebuke. The two of them really are quite alike. Regardless, Misaka vents to Uiharu, but their meeting is interrupted by Kuroko, who drags Uiharu back to work. However, in their rush, Uiharu leaves her Judgement armband behind.

Coincidentally, as Misaka is holding the armband, she's spotted by Konori, who mistakes Misaka for a Judgement officer who's meant to be providing her with backup. For how famous Misaka is supposed to be, people don't really recognize her face. Misaka, seeing an opportunity to prove to Kuroko that Judgement work isn't all that difficult, drops into the role.

With all the action Kuroko and Uiharu find themselves in, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Judgement *is* the local law enforcement; however, as I've said, that's not the case. Misaka begins learning this lesson herself as her first job is sweeping a sidewalk. Other highlights include giving directions, helping a kid with a broken RC helicopter (not entirely successfully), and saving a female student being harassed (not actually; the guy was really her boyfriend). Being in Judgement, as it turns out, isn't always all that glamorous.

Finally, Konori receives a call about their next job: finding a lost bag for a young girl, which was stolen by a dog. This bag was a birthday gift from her parents and therefore really important to her. Naturally, it's up to Judgement to handle the search for the bag.

Remember the graviton bomber? So does Misaka, and she's extra motivated to find that bag before it can end up in a crowded area.

After several misadventures, they make their way to a park. Misaka, as it turns out, isn't very good with kids, and her Tokiwadai uniform stands out. Regardless, the dog that they're looking for is spotted, and Misaka swoops in to collect the bag.

As it turns out, there's no bomb inside the bag. There is, however, a good learning moment for Misaka: Judgement does a lot more than it seems like they do on the surface.

This does not mean that the graviton bombings are over. Post-credits, Judgement officers evacuate a convenience store where an elevated level of gravitons has been detected. In the panic, a student gets trampled and needs assistance from one of the officers, just in time for the bomb to go off. The officer protects the girl, but he doesn't get off so well.

In a city with around 2.3 million people, with the only possible suspect definitively ruled out, finding the attacker is going to be a challenge.

## Episode 7

All hands are on deck at Judgement as the scale and power of the gravaton bombings continue to increase. Considering that Judgement's primary purpose is supposed to be general peacekeeping, a crisis of this scale seems a bit out of their league, but what do I know?

During Konori's briefing on the status of the graviton investigation, we're briefly introduced to Hatsuya Kaitabi, the kid with glasses. You might recognize him from an in-passing encounter with Misaka in the last episode during her stint as a Judgement officer. You've probably also guessed, since the show keeps bringing him up, that he's going to be plot-relevant shortly.

Kuroko and Uiharu are both very busy with the case, leaving Misaka and Saten to find ways to amuse themselves. Tangentially, you'll note that in Uiharu and Saten's scene, their teacher is giving that exploration in AIM Diffusion Fields I promised earlier.

The problem is that Judgement can't find any common thread between any of the bombings, and the Academy City databank doesn't have any entries on Espers that fit the ability type and strength. Kuroko muses that it could be someone who had an extremely rapid increase in strength recently, an idea that Uiharu quickly shoots down as impossible.

Saten and Misaka coincidentally meet and discuss how hard their friends are working on the case. Misaka has the idea of taking advantage of Uiharu and Kuroko's day off to have a shopping trip together, but Kuroko still has Judgement work that she wants to do, leaving the party of only three.

Mid-trip, Misaka runs into Touma, who is escorting the bag girl from last episode on a trip for a new dress. This girl actually has a name: Kana Hazamaya, and she actually shows up quite a bit throughout the anime and even in the PSP game that people probably don't realize exists.

Elsewhere, Kuroko and Konori are still trying to pin down the common thread between the graviton bombings, to little success. However, Konori gives Kuroko a brainwave: a disproportionate number of Judgement officers have been injured in these attacks. In fact, *only* Judgement officers have been injured in the bombings.

It finally clicks for them: Judgement are the targets.

Before we have a chance to explore that further, another graviton spike is detected at the Seventh Mist department store. Coincidentally, this is the exact department store that Misaka, Uiharu, and Saten are spending the day at, and one of them has been sporting a Judgement armband.

Who am I trying to fool? You know full well that it's not a coincidence.

Kuroko calls Uiharu back to the branch office, but Uiharu decides to spring into action instead, facilitating the evacuation of the store and getting everyone to safety. They manage a safe and successful evacuation, but Kana has disappeared at some point. Misaka and Touma rush in to try to track her down.

Meanwhile, Uiharu reaches out to Kuroko to report the successful evacuation, and Kuroko finally has an opportunity to break the news to Uiharu: *she* is actually the target of this specific attack.

Kana shows up in this moment to show up, holding a frog plush toy given to her by a strange man with glasses. You have to be a pretty sick kind of person to use a literal child as bait like that.

Misaka tries to use her railgun to blast the bomb away, but slips, dropping the coin with no time to prepare another. Fortunately, Touma swoops in to intercept just before the bomb blows.

In an alley in the distance, Kaitabi is celebrating this success until Misaka shows up and breaks the news to him: no one was harmed in the explosion. Kaitabi gives a final villainous monologue about how people with power only use it to abuse people who don't, which Misaka doesn't appreciate, earning him a punch to the face for his efforts. Kuroko shows up to clean up, musing that Misaka probably would have been able to beat Kaitabi even if she didn't have her powers.

> "Even if she was a level 1 instead of a level 5, I have a feeling she still would have been able to get the best of you."

Kaitabi can moan about how useless Judgement is all he wants, but he doesn't seem to be able to see the irony of the fact that his own actions are at least partially responsible for his situation. If Judgement wasn't busy chasing the graviton bomber, maybe they would have been able to intervene more to help him. By attacking them and sending them on a wild goose chase, all he was doing was sabotaging himself.

In the aftermath, Kuroko, perceptive as ever, picks up on the inconsistencies of the explosion pattern. There's no way Misaka's ability would have been able to cause that effect. Regardless, with no other explanation, she chooses to accept the story of Misaka's heroics.

Post-credits, Misaka ambushes Touma, not to fight, but just to talk. With Misaka being hailed as a hero, she notes that Touma could have the credit if he just came forward about how *he* was the true hero. Touma, in Touma fashion, brushes it off, just happy that no one was hurt and not worried about taking credit.

Just shonen protagonist things.

## Episode 8

It isn't really made super clear in the anime, but Uiharu has a bit of a weak immune system. In this episode, she's come down with a cold, meaning she has to miss the day of classes.

Kuroko, meanwhile, is a bit distracted by Kaitabi. Despite having level 4 strength, he's listed in the databank as a level 2 Esper.

Sound familiar? This is a lot like the case of a certain girl with rather distinct eyebrows from a few episodes ago.

Misaka decides to take Kuroko for shaved ice to keep her mind off things, and we briefly explore the concept of synesthesia. The term is used a bit inaccurately here to refer to multiple senses being stimulated by a single source, like, for example, how a red color might make you think of something warm. This might seem like a completely random topic to explore, but just hold the thought for a bit.

The two run into Saten, who is on her way to drop off some notes for Uiharu, and they tag along to check on her. Being a workaholic seems to be a prerequisite for working in Judgement, and Uiharu can't help but ask for an update on the graviton bomber case. This leads to Saten once again bringing up the legend of the Level Upper, the device that supposedly lets you increase your ability level. Kuroko notes that Kaitabi isn't the first time an Esper's strength hasn't matched their recorded ability level.

Remember Ryouta all the way in episode 1? Taking him, Juufuku, and now Kaitabi, that's three instances of databank mismatches, with plenty more that we just haven't seen. There's something happening with these Espers that's causing them to experience a sharp increase in power.

Apparently, some of the Level Upper users hang out on a specific online message board, which Uiharu manages to track down without issue. They even mention a specific restaurant that they're planning to meet at. Misaka jumps at the information, much to Kuroko's chagrin.

Reluctantly, Kuroko and Misaka team up to gather information on the Level Upper, with Misaka playing the front man and Kuroko hiding in the back to observe.

Unfortunately, Misaka isn't a very good actor.

Fortunately, her Tokiwadai uniform marks her as a big payday if cards are played right, so her audience takes the bait.

Once outside, the group tries to shake her down, which is where Misaka's patience finally snaps. After zapping the first goon, the rest gang up on her, which doesn't end well for them.

Their boss doesn't show her goons any sympathy, forcing them to apologize for the shakedown and sending them on their way. Unfortunately for Misaka, she also feels obliged to pay Misaka back for the beating her underlings received. Her ability is Flux Coat, an ability that lets her control the viscosity and shape of the asphalt around them. I really hope there's more utility to that, because otherwise that's a really lame ability.

Say it with me: if you can generate an electrical current, you can generate a magnetic field. In this case, Misaka uses it with the rebar in the building walls to climb them. If the ground's not stable, just avoid it. Yet another neat toy in her bag of level 5 tricks.

The boss manages to egg Misaka on and make her stop holding back. Unfortunately, Kuroko shows up too late to warn Misaka that they're very close to a power substation.

At least Judgement get a good workout acting as traffic cops while Academy City works out the blackout issue.

Misaka didn't get any information out of that excursion, but the next day, a new development occurs: Kaitabi has fallen into a coma.

He isn't the only one. Most notably, Juufuku and Ryouta have collapsed as well. Without any clear signs of trauma or other medical issues, the hospital is forced to call in a specialist: Harumi Kiyama.

You might know her as the Undresstress.

Meanwhile, Saten, searching for new music, stumbles upon a hidden link on her preferred download site, and she comes across a download that will change the course of her life.

## Episode 9

Misaka's electrical incident from the day before has left the hospital underpowered. Emergency power is keeping critical operations underway, but niceties like air conditioning don't make the cut. Regardless, Misaka and Kuroko stay overnight to catch Dr. Kiyama the next morning to ask some questions. Dr. Kiyama agrees, on the condition that they take the conversation somewhere more comfortable.

Dr. Kiyama leads the conversation with a truly philosophical question that has been and will be debated until the end of time.

> "Why are swimsuits acceptable and underwear is not when both expose the same amount of skin?"

Kuroko and Misaka give the kind of well-thought-out answer the question deserved.

> "No. That isn't the point."

Back on topic, Kuroko tries to grill Kiyama on the Level Upper. Unfortunately, without any real concrete details on what the Level Upper even is, it's a bit difficult for Kiyama to provide any real information. Regardless, Kiyama agrees to use her expertise however she can, since she does specialize in brains.

The serious moment is interrupted by Saten and Uiharu, who are eventually invited to join the meeting. Saten is as helpful as ever.

> "Are you here to look at Shirai's brain?"

Once again returning to the task at hand, Saten is excited to show off the Level Upper until Misaka reveals that Judgement and Anti-Skill plan to take anyone caught with a Level Upper into custody. On top of the developments regarding the safety of it, it seems that Academy City is treating it as an illegal drug.

So, Saten decides to keep the information to herself.

Once the meeting breaks up, Saten runs off, and Misaka runs after her. We get a nice scene between the two of them. We get to see the lucky charm that Saten always carries with her for the first time. While mostly just a symbol currently, it actually will serve some meaningful plot purpose in the future.

Saten laments her lack of usefulness to the Level Upper investigation and the lack of progress in the Ability Development Program. Misaka does her best to encourage Saten.

> "Does your level matter that much?"

It's not very helpful.

The next day, Uiharu and Kuroko continue their investigation. Uiharu manages to put together a list of possible locations where Level Upper users could be hanging out. With no other leads, Kuroko begins running through them one by one.

Meanwhile, Saten tries to work up the courage to either use or destroy the Level Upper. While she's contemplating, she's interrupted by someone who is being scammed while attempting to purchase it for himself. Unfortunately, Saten's phone has died, but she decides to intervene anyway.

All she accomplishes is putting herself in the crosshairs of the thugs.

Fortunately, Kuroko happens to be in the area.

Three versus one isn't a very fair fight when the one can transport herself through eleven-dimensional space, so two of the thugs are easily taken care of, leaving just the leader.

The leader is a much more difficult fight.

Kuroko isn't able to easily anticipate her opponent's movements, and she has a hard time hitting him with her metal spikes. As she attempts to block a melee attack, the thug's leg moves at an impossible angle. In one final attempt to understand what she's up against, Kuroko teleports one final spike.

The spike curves impossibly.

Outmatched and in need of a plan, Kuroko decides to run further into the abandoned building she's been knocked into.

The thug happens to have one more trick up his sleeve: sound reverberates, and the building happens to be a hideout that they're very familiar with.

Kuroko continues to run, but is eventually cornered. The thug gloats, taunting Kuroko with the fact that she still has no idea what his ability is. Kuroko, however, has figured it out: optical manipulation. Specifically, he has the ability to manipulate light to project the image of himself to a different location, an ability that he's dubbed Trick Art.

Fortunately, Kuroko has her own trick up her sleeve.

Question: If an object is teleported to a destination where it would intersect with another object, what would happen?

Answer: The matter of the source object would move the matter of the destination object, splitting it. Kuroko demonstrates this by splitting a concrete support pillar with a sheet of window glass.

There are a lot of windows and a lot of pillars in this building.

Next question: what would happen if all the support pillars in an abandoned building that's been scheduled for demolition were strategically split in half?

Kuroko's a clever girl. Her excursion through the building wasn't just an attempt to run away.

Fortunately for Trick, Kuroko still needs him. Thanks to her teleportation, he ends up no worse for wear, although understandably quite terrified by the experience of almost getting crushed by an imploding building. It's enough to soften him up to deliver a bombshell.

> "The Level Upper... it's a song..."

Anti-Skill shows up on cue to complete the arrest, thanks to Saten.

Still, Kuroko's heroics haven't improved Saten's self-loathing. In her moment of weakness, she runs into a few of her friends. When the conversation shifts to the Level Upper, Saten has the courage to do what she wasn't able to do when she was alone.

> "I have one, you know? I've got one of them."

## Episode 10

Remember when I said that level 0 meant "no ability"? It would be more accurate to say "no discernible ability". Level 0s like Saten always had an ability; they just had no way of knowing exactly what that ability was. Until now, at least.

Saten's ability is Aero Hand, an ability that seems to be relatively common in the Raildex universe. Manifestations vary, but it seems to mostly refer to any ability that involves manipulating air currents. If you were curious, it's also an ability held by one Mitsuko Kongou.

Regardless, the Level Upper has worked, and Saten and her friends are now full-fledged Espers. This will have consequences for everyone later.

As much as Uiharu and Kuroko would like to investigate how exactly a song could be responsible for both the level increases and the comas, Level Upper-related crimes are on the rise, and Kuroko is kept very busy trying to maintain peace in the city, getting herself quite beaten up in the process.

Uiharu, meanwhile, stays in contact with Kiyama about the Level Upper. Kiyama mentions a device called a Testament, which is used to basically install information directly into a person's brain. Misaka stops by the 177th branch to hang out, and the three discuss things further.

The problem with the Testament is that it stimulates all five senses, while the Level Upper only stimulates one. How, then, could a song emulate the effect of a Testament?

Remember synesthesia? After a quick prompt from Misaka, Kuroko does too. Kiyama confirms that this is a possible solution, and Judgement has a real lead again. Kiyama mentions that she might be able to get permission to use Tree Diagram to work out a solution to the Level Upper problem now that they know more about how it works, and Uiharu starts to head to Kiyama's lab for an opportunity to see Tree Diagram in action.

Remember when I said Saten's actions would have consequences later? It's later.

Akemi is the first casualty, collapsing while training her new power in the park. Now realizing the gravity of the situation, Saten rushes home and calls Uiharu.

[What follows is Uiharu giving one of the greatest speeches in the franchise.](https://streamable.com/vamnvb)

> "Being a level 0 doesn't make you defective! Even without abilities, you're so full of life and energy it's a challenge to keep up with you every day! No amount of power could make you more incredible than you already are to me! You're my best friend in the world! So stop it! Just stop it! Stop saying such horrible things... because they aren't true!"

Sometimes dialogue just speaks for itself.

Undeterred (or perhaps more motivated) by the casualty of Saten, Uiharu returns to her original goal of visiting Kiyama's lab to figure out a cure to the comas. Misaka, equally motivated by the poor way she handled the meeting with Saten in the last episode, begs Kuroko to be involved in the investigation. Kuroko recognizes just how personal this situation is to Misaka and agrees to let her help.

Misaka and Kuroko are called out by a doctor with a very distinct frog-like face. If you aren't familiar with Raildex, this man's name is Heaven Canceller, and he's just as much of a badass as his name makes him sound, but that's a topic for another time.

The doctor informs Misaka and Kuroko of an interesting development: all of the victims of the Level Upper share an identical brain wave pattern. This is not normal, and points to some kind of outside interference.

Back at the 177th branch, Kuroko and Misaka call on some help from Konori regarding the brainwave pattern. While Konori is searching the databank, the question comes up of exactly how syncing a bunch of brainwaves together could cause an increase in ability level. The anime explains it quite poorly, using the analogy of many computers connected together on a network, so let me take a stab at it.

Let's take the project [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org), which runs simulations of how proteins "fold" or change shape and assemble themselves. The goal of the project is to find solutions to cure, or at least better understand, various diseases that result from proteins folding incorrectly. These simulations take a lot of computing power on their own and would be very expensive to run. So, the Folding@home project distributes the load across many computers by providing software to allow people to donate their spare computing resources to the project. With the load split like this, simulations can be done faster and more efficiently.

Now, let's consider how Esper abilities work again. While abilities are all about breaking the laws of science, they *are* still based in science, so the Esper still needs to make proper calculations to utilize their ability effectively. Kuroko needs to be able to calculate paths through eleven-dimensional space, Misaka needs to calculate just how much electricity it takes to create the perfect magnetic field for launching her Railgun, and so on. While a single brain could do these calculations, many brains working together could do them faster and more efficiently. This is manifested in a higher ability level.

Still, Folding@home needs a network connection for all the computers to talk to each other, and so do these brains. Konori guesses that AIM Diffusion Fields are being used as a link, with the master brain wave pattern being used as a common protocol for all of the brains to share data with each other.

Regardless, the important thing is finding the brainwave pattern that matches the one exhibited in the Level Upper victims. Konori finds a match: Harumi Kiyama.

Uiharu meanwhile, has discovered that Kiyama has collected a lot of research regarding synesthesia. Unfortunately, as she's snooping, Kiyama walks in on her.

While Kuroko tries to talk Misaka out of getting involved, Misaka has already realized that Kuroko is injured and insists on taking the lead on the search for Kiyama. Kiyama, meanwhile, has already fled with Uiharu.

It's taken a while to get here, but things are really starting to kick off.

## Episode 11

In typical anime antagonist fashion, Kiyama explains her plan to her captive. She was trying to create a network of brains to use as a computational platform, a lot like the Folding example I gave earlier. As for the "why", it was because she had been denied access to Tree Diagram for a project she was working on. As a show of goodwill, she gives Uiharu the antidote to the Level Upper, promising that everyone will be back to normal once she's finished with them.

Unfortunately, Anti-Skill is a bit sloppy with Kiyama's lab, and they trigger a failsafe that wipes all records of her research. The antidote in Uiharu's possession is the only hope for the victims of the Level Upper.

Anti-Skill has also mobilized to block Kiyama's escape. Unfortunately for them, Kiyama has something of a trick up her sleeve.

According to the databank, Kiyama never took part in the Ability Development Program, meaning she shouldn't be able to exhibit even level 0 power. However, remember the side effect of the Level Upper that made it so attractive to weak Espers: an increase in ability. With thousands of people in her network and as many abilities at her disposal, Kiyama can not only use an ability, she's able to do the impossible: use more than one ability. She has become the theoretical phenomenon that Academy City's researchers have been chasing for years: Dual Skill.

Kiyama would disagree with that assessment. She prefers the term "Multi-Skill".

Needless to say, by the time Misaka arrives on the scene, Anti-Skill has been completely wiped out.

Kiyama is clever in her use of abilities, but so is Misaka, and she manages to catch Kiyama off guard with a feint, getting in close enough to shock her at point-blank range.

Somehow, probably due to the effect of the Level Upper, this also causes Misaka to begin seeing some of Kiyama's memories.

Children that have been orphaned or otherwise abandoned in Academy City are referred to as "Child Errors". There are various orphanages in the city to help care for them, but they also tend to get caught up in some of Academy City's human experiments. This is how Harumi Kiyama found herself reluctantly being thrust into the role of teacher by Gensei Kihara.

If you're not familiar with the Raildex universe, you should note that the name "Kihara" is anathema in Academy City, and none moreso than the patriarch, Gensei Kihara.

You've probably noticed that Kiyama isn't a very emotional person, so teaching these Child Errors wasn't something she particularly relished.

Until she saw Banri Edasaki out in the rain, brought her to her home, and realized that she cared for these children more than she realized.

And so, when Kihara's experiment involving sending abilities into overdrive went wildly wrong, it affected her quite a bit.

This is why, after being rejected 23 times from using Tree Diagram, Kiyama went to the extreme trying to find a way to wake up those children.

> "I would do anything to save them. Anything in the entire world. The whole city can hate and revile me! I don't care! I'm not going to let anything stop me now!"

Unfortunately, something stops her now.

The Level Upper network has escaped Kiyama's control, giving birth to a new enemy that looks disturbingly like a fetus.

Japan is weird.

## Episode 12

This is the AIM Burst, the physical form of the AIM Diffusion Fields of all the Espers who have used the Level Upper. It's a collection of the despair of ten thousand students who have been mistreated by a system where power is the most important thing. It's so powerful that not even the third most powerful person in the city is any match for it on her own.

Fortunately, Kiyama has a solution: if the Level Upper network is disassembled, then maybe the AIM Burst will be destroyed, or at least severely weakened.

So, it's up to Uiharu to deliver the antidote to Anti-Skill while Misaka keeps the AIM Burst distracted.

Unfortunately, the AIM Burst is headed straight for a nuclear power plant.

And they say nuclear power is safe.

Regardless, Uiharu succeeds in delivering the antidote, which is played across the city. While it succeeds in weakening the AIM Burst, it doesn't destroy it entirely. It's up to Misaka to destroy the core.

You would think a city where people are given magical psychic powers would be a dream come true. However, as at least ten thousand people can attest, it can also be a nightmare. The teachers, the government, even other students look down on anyone who doesn't have power. The AIM Burst speaks with the voices of all those people and their regrets.

So, Misaka does what she can to help put those regrets to rest.

Regardless of how noble her intentions may have been, Kiyama is still responsible for creating and distributing an illegal drug. Although she's arrested by Anti-Skill, she swears that she'll be back with another plan to save those children.

Meanwhile, the victims have woken up, including Saten, back to her level 0 self. As much as she regrets not having any power, she regrets everything she put Uiharu through.

Still, our quartet are mostly back to their energetic, rambunctious selves. It's nice to see everything begin going back to normal.

## Episode 13

With everything settled, it's time for some long-overdue filler. Everyone loves filler, right? Right? Anyone?

Remember Wannai and Awatsuki from way back in episode 2? As part of the swim club, they've been invited to take part in a swimsuit photoshoot, and they want assistance from Misaka and Kuroko.

I'm sure you see where this is going. This is the obligatory beach episode.

Uiharu and Saten are invited along as well, along with Konori and one Mitsuko Kongou.

Academy City, as it turns out, has invented a holodeck, which is used as the backdrop for the photoshoot. Unfortunately, it goes a little haywire, resulting in a wild swing between several extreme environments before ending up at a campsite, where the gang decides to make curry while they wait for repairs.

Not really much of substance happens in this. If you're keeping track at home, the most notable development is Kongou getting more familiar with the core group, particularly the start of her friendship with Wannai and Awatsuki and her friendship with Misaka, both of which will be plot relevant in the future.

Once the photoshoot concludes, Misaka borrows the film studio to try out a swimsuit she was too embarrassed to try on earlier. Unfortunately, she doesn't entirely understand how to use the controls and ends up broadcasting herself to the video board outside the studio.

Why do they even have that button?

## Episode 14

Saten has been selected to take part in a special city-wide workshop on what is supposed to be a day off. It doesn't take long for them to figure out exactly how the selection process took place: all the participants were users of the Level Upper.

Unsurprisingly, they're a bit bitter about the extra classes that they perceive as punishment.

Raildex veterans may recognize both the school and the small teacher from "A Certain Magical Index" proper. This is the school that Touma Kamijou attends, and the teacher, Komoe Tsukuyomi, is Touma's homeroom teacher.

Unfortunately, Saten forgot her lunch, and the vending machines aren't in service. She happens to run into Juufuku, who still has a bit of an obsession with Saten. As uncomfortable as the interaction is, Juufuku offers to share lunch with Saten, an offer that Saten can't refuse.

The next part of the workshop is PE, led by Aiho Yomikawa, who runs them hard. The students push back, but Yomikawa explains the true purpose of the workshop. It's not a punishment; it's an attempt to teach them to overcome what they perceive as their limits.

> "When you convince yourself you can't do anymore, you're finished, even though you may still have some strength left that you're just unaware of."

Komoe explains further: now that they've had a taste of what having an ability feels like, they can use that feeling to try to overcome the limits that they've built for themselves.

Some people in Academy City really do see the students as more than just test subjects, and this is their way of trying to truly help them. And it seems to help, just a little. Even if their levels don't go up, it's a step to help them continue to grow.

## Conclusion

With the first arc of the anime coming to a close, how good is my first love?

Pretty dang good.

When I watched Railgun for the first time, I had expected a slightly more laid-back villain-of-the-week-style show. What I got was a world way more deep and intense than I imagined, and all of that continues to hold up almost a decade after my first time going through it. The setting is engaging, and the characters are all charming and lovable. The comedy still lands, and the drama still hits just as hard. Overall, watching Railgun again is a great reminder of why it's been my favorite for so long.

The best part? It only gets better from here.
