## Transcript

So, what did I think of the Teal Mask?

It was better than I expected, but also my expectations were to the floor. I had very low expectations coming in.

It is a master class in how not to level scale something. The battles were trivial. The hardest battle was Okidogi, and even that one I wasn't really in any danger. It was not a very difficult DLC.

The story wasn't bad. Carmine and Kieran are the worst characters in the entire Pokémon franchise. I hated them so much. I hated interacting with them. They're so awful. So, that would be the biggest downside of this DLC, is having to deal with those two.

Whatever that game with riding around and popping the balloons was, that was not super fun. I would love to not have to do that game again.

But as far as story and everything and overall enjoyment goes, it was fine. It was a perfectly fine DLC.
