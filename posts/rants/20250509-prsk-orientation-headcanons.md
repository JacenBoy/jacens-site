title: Project Sekai Orientation Headcanons

I don't know why this is something that's been on my mind, but I've been thinking about my headcanons for the orientations and identities of the various characters in the Project Sekai franchise. Here's a quick overview of my thoughts and why I think that way. 
<!-- more -->

## Ichika Hoshino

Ichika is bisexual, oddly enough. For whatever reason, Ichika is pretty easy for me to headcanon as straight. However, her relationship with the other members of Leo/need, particularly Saki, is undeniable. She also has good chemistry with some other characters, like Nene and Kanade. As such, I put her in the bi camp. 

## Saki Tenma

Saki is also bisexual. Like Ichika, Saki is easy for me to view as straight, likely due to her vaguely "gyaru"-esque personality and design. That said, she's also very affectionate with Leo/need, as well as a handful of other characters. Therefore, like Ichika, I headcanon her a bi.

## Honami Mochizuki

Honami is harder to pin down. While she's close with Leo/need, her interactions feel more platonic than anything else. Without much information to go on, it's easier to place her as asexual.

## Shiho Hinomori

Like Honami, while she cares a lot for her friends, there isn't really anything romantic to go off. She also seems very focused on her music. Overall, it's even easier to headcanon her as asexual.

## Minori Hanasato

Minori is idolsexual. Obviously, Minori has a very strong attraction to Haruka. However, she also has [some interesting interactions with Len](https://nitter.net/ColorfulStageEN/status/1811883231567888470) that are hard to write off as purely platonic. I'd argue that Minori is attracted to idols in general, regardless of gender. I'm not sure if it qualifies as pansexual, but she seems to be along those lines.

## Haruka Kiritani

Haruka is straight. Before you crucify me for that, hear me out. Haruka's interactions seem to be primarily platonic, and there isn't a lot of romantic subtext to work with (even for Minori). Based on previous examples, that would put her in the asexual camp. However, for reasons I can't really explain, Haruka is *extremely* easy to headcanon as straight. I don't really have much logic to go off, but that's where she lands for me.

## Airi Momoi

Airi is Shizuku's lesbian girlfriend. The two of them get along like an old married couple, and it's impossible to headcanon anything else. 

## Shizuku Hinomori

See above. Shizuku and Airi are girlfriends.

## An Shiraishi

An is clearly very obsessed with Kohane, but she also has pretty good chemistry with Akito, so I'm marking her down as bisexual.

## Kohane Azusawa

While Kohane does have some good chemistry with Toya (and, to a much lesser extent, Akito), it's difficult for me to see her as anything other than lesbian.

## Akito Shinonome

Much like An, Akito has a strong bond with Toya in addition to his chemistry with An, so he's firmly in the bisexual camp.

## Toya Aoyagi

Like Kohane, Toya's bond with Akito overshadows his chemistry with Kohane, making it difficult to see him as anything other than gay.

## Emu Otori

Emu doesn't really have a lot of interactions that can be seen as romantic. She does, however, have good chemistry with Tsukasa and an interesting relationship with Mafuyu. I'd say asexual is probably the closest to accurate, but Emu really is a toss-up.

## Tsukasa Tenma

Tsukasa has strong chemistry with Emu and Nene, but also with Rui, Toya, and (to a lesser extent) Akito. With all that in mind, I'd headcanon him as bisexual.

## Nene Kusanagi

While Nene is childhood friends with Rui and has good chemistry with Tsukasa, she also has a close relationship with Emu and a good friendship with Ichika. It's a bit of a toss-up, but Nene seems to trend closer to the straight side of the spectrum.

## Rui Kamishiro

While it's easy to headcanon Rui as gay and pair him and Tsukasa together, I'm sure arguments could be made for other headcanons, continuing the trend of WxS being difficult to pin down.

## Kanade Yoisaki

Kanade comes off as asexual, uninterested in any kind of romance. However, as her relationship with Mafuyu grows, I can see her sliding toward the lesbian side of the spectrum.

## Mafuyu Asahina

Mafuyu also seems like she's asexual (or, rather, too depressed to care about romance). Like Kanade, however, her relationship with Kanade definitely has growing romantic tones, and I can see her being a lesbian once the depression issue it brought under control.

## Mizuki Akiyama

Mizuki's orientation is pretty intricately linked to gender identity, and it's pretty obvious that Mizuki is intended to be trans coded (even if Colorful Palette will never officially confirm it). With that in mind, combined with her strong bond with Ena, Mizuki falls pretty firmly into the lesbian camp.

## Ena Shinonome

Beyond her close bond with Mizuki, Ena has fantastic chemistry with Kanade and interesting chemistry with Mafuyu. Even on top of that, she has good chemistry with a lot of the other characters she's interacted with. All that to say, Ena is firmly in the lesbian camp.

Project Sekai doesn't really put a lot of romantic undertones in their character relationships outside of a few specific examples. Because of that, headcanons like this are very fluid, and can change moment to moment. That said, these are the basic ones that I was able to come up with based on vibes. Your mileage, of course, may vary.
