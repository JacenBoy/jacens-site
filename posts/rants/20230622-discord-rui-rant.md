An excerpt from Discord regarding a Reddit post I saw.

A few people said "Rui"
so let's talk about Rui
His backstory is that he was mostly abandoned by his friends
because he kept getting them involved in things they didn't want to be involved in and kept getting them hurt
He does things for his own curiosity and amusement and doesn't think about the feelings of anyone else
He had an entire event around him actually considering other people's feelings
and the rest of WxS said "no, you must stop considering the feelings of others"
He is not misunderstood or misinterpreted; he is just actively a bad character
Between all of the idol and idol-adjacent franchises I have consumed, he is the only character who I actively dislike
