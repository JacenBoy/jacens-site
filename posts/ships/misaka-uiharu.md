This is probably the least popular Railgun ship. While there aren't a ton of interactions between Misaka and Uiharu, it's clear that Uiharu idolizes Misaka a lot, particularly from episodes 1 and 19, and they have good chemistry in the situations that they do interact. Definitely a rarepair worth considering.
