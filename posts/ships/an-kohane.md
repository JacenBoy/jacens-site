I would argue that no ship in Project Sekai is strictly canon, but this is one of the handful that are as close to canon as you can get. An's obsession with Kohane is a bit too much to be written off as purely platonic, and VBS's theme of "partners" only adds fuel to the flame. My only complaint is that the fandom seems to like making Kohane the dominant one a bit too much. I get the appeal of gap moe, but it's okay to just let Kohane bottom.
