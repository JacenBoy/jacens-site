I know hetero Project Sekai ships are basically heresy, but hear me out. This is certainly a crack ship, but it's at least canon that Airi and Aiko have met, so it's grounded in that at least. I just really like [a specific piece of fanart](https://x.com/Keeta__k/status/1468265337322094595/photo/2) involving the two. The idea of Akito having a soft spot for his sister's friends is just really cute to me. Also, any ship that involves Ena suffering is very funny.
