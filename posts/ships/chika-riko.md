Definitely the "preferred" ship of Sunshine's first season. It's undeniable that Chika and Riko have chemistry. They're both very important to each other's stories from as early as episode 1. However, the ship is a bit soured for me by how aggressively it's shoved down our throats throughout the first season to create the "doomed childhood friend" scenario with You. At least they lighten up and shift to the superior ship for season 2.
