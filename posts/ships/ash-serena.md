This is more or less the beginning of my shipping addiction. X&Y was also the first season of the Pokémon anime, so I'm a bit biased in that regard as well. With that said, Ash and Serena definitely have a lot of chemistry. She was the first companion that already knew Ash before their journey, and her interactions with Ash were a great indicator of how much Ash had grown and matured over his various journeys. Amourshipping was my first love, and I'll be an Amourshipper for life.
