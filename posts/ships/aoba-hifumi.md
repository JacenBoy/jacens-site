This has the feel of a "mentor/mentee" relationship, although Hifumi doesn't really do a lot of mentoring to Aoba. Throughout the show, the relationship Aoba forms with Hifumi is only second to her bond with Ko. Somehow, Hifumi's quiet shyness and Aoba's awkward enthusiasm mix very well, creating a very solid relationship dynamic.
