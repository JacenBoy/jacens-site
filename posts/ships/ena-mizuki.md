I would argue that no ship in Project Sekai is strictly canon, but this is one of the handful that are as close to canon as you can get. Ena and Mizuki are obviously very close, and Ena is integral to Mizuki's entire character arc. Likewaise, Mizuki is important to portions of Ena's arc, including her fifth focus event. I don't think there's a lot I can say other than "this ship is all but canon".
