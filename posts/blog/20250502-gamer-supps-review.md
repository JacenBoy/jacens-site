title: Reviewing the Gamer Supps Experience

A Twitch streamer I watch got an affiliate code with Gamer Supps recently and has begun shilling it pretty hard. I like trying new foods and drinks, and I'll try almost anything at least once. Because they have a free sample option, I decided to use his code to get a couple of free packs to see just what it tasted like.
<!-- more -->

For reference, I mixed each of the three packs into a 16.9 oz (500 mL) bottle of Aldi-brand PurAqua water, since that's what I happened to have lying around. I also intentionally did not look up anything about the flavors to avoid any preconceived ideas.

## Initial Impressions

The sample packs came in a standard envelope with standard postage. It's a pretty good way to save cost on a promotion that doesn't make them any money, so I respect the simplicity.

Gamer Supps sends you three random flavors for the free sample, so you get what you get. I ended up with Lemonade, Guacamole Gamer Fart 9000, and Blo'hole Blast.

I don't really care for Gamer Supps' cringe anime marketing. Even for me, it's a bit over the top. Some of the packaging and flavor names are even borderline NSFW, so keep that in mind if you're planning on bringing it into the office.

## Sweetening The Deal

To lay it all on the table: Gamer Supps are sweetened using erythritol and sucralose instead of sugar.

Even ignoring the fact that [artificial sweeteners aren't as healthy as you're led to believe](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/whats-worse-sugar-or-artificial-sweetener), erythritol in particular has been linked to [heart attack and stroke risks](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/erythritol). If that concerns you, you might want to skip Gamersupps entirely. If it doesn't, probably still drink in moderation.

Less seriously, erythritol can also cause digestive issues, such as bloating, cramps, or diarrhea. As a NASCAR fan, I tried out a pack of Kyle Busch's Rowdy Energy, which also used erythritol, and experienced these symptoms first-hand, so that's another reason to take advantage of the free sample before committing to your purchase.

To add insult to injury, I don't really care for the taste of artificial sweeteners like aspartame or sucralose, so that will definitely affect my impressions a bit.

With all that preamble out of the way, let's get into the actual tasting.

## Lemonade

One of the few flavors to have a normal name. The art on the packaging, however, was less so.

This one had a very stereotypical lemonade mix flavor. It's not too tangy, but it's also not as refreshing a proper lemonade. If you're into that kind of fake lemon flavor that's common in these kinds of drink mixes, this will probably taste familiar to you. I didn't initially pick up on the sucralose flavor, but it did eventually sneak its way in as I got to the end of the bottle. Even then, it wasn't overpowering, although I absolutely did taste the lack of sugar. Overall, it's not something I would spend money to drink, but I wouldn't turn it away if it was placed in front of me.

## Guacamole Gamer Fart 9000

Surely, they didn't create a guacamole flavored energy drink, right?

Fortunately, no. Cringe marketing aside, this one had a pretty strong lime flavor and a similar mouthfeel to the lemonade, if a bit less strong. Notably, the sucralose flavor was much less pronounced in this one. Once again, this isn't a flavor I would go out of my way to try, but I still enjoyed it as a free thing. 

## Blo'hole Blast

Have I mentioned how much I hate the branding? I think I mentioned how much I hate the branding.

I'm not a coconut fan, and this one had an extremely strong coconut flavor. That combined with the two artificial not-sugar flavors made this one easily the worst of the three. This is the only one I can say I disliked, with the coconut overpowering all other flavors.

## The Energy

Gamer Supps does advertise itself as an energy drink, and I did feel a bit of a caffeine kick after drinking it, so I'd say it's effective. Gamer Supps is pretty up-front about this, but if you have some kind of medical condition or caffeine sensitivity, keep that in mind.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'd say the flavors I received were inoffensive. I didn't fall in love with any of them, but I also didn't refuse to drink any of them either. Notably, I didn't notice any of the digestive issues I had with Rowdy. I did notice a slight burn in my throat, although I'm not sure if that's because all three flavors had a citrus component or if it was something with Gamer Supps itself.

As someone who doesn't have an affiliate code or any plans to get one, I would say that, if you aren't scared off by the cringe branding or the artificial sweeteners, it's worth grabbing a code from a creator you support and getting a free sample just to test things out for yourself.
